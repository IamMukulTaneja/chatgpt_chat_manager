# ChatGPT Chat Manager Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that helps you efficiently manage your ChatGPT conversations. Easily view, organize, and bulk delete your chat history with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## ü§ñ AI-Generated Code

This project was entirely generated using AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) through pair programming. The AI assistant helped in:
- Designing the architecture
- Writing all the code components
- Creating the documentation
- Implementing best practices
- Handling edge cases and error scenarios

While the code is AI-generated, it has been thoroughly tested and follows modern development standards. This project serves as an example of how AI can be used to create practical, production-ready software.
